# Notes on Improvement from Cohort 2

## General Ideas

## Unit 1

## Unit 2

In general, the students felt that:

- We should have introduced, visually, at a high level, the path we were going to take through this unit
- We should have introduced APIs at the end of the unit so we don't get them confused by two different types of requests, at the least we should have separated those ideas with enough time
- Project 2 week was too short
