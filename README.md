- Whiteboarding was fun, but scary
- Pre-work was too difficult, and they wanted more support while doing it
- They would have liked more modeling and instructors running through solutions

## Unit 2

In general, the students felt that:

- We should have introduced APIs at the end of the unit so we don't get them confused by two different types of requests, at the least we should have separated those ideas with enough time
- Project 2 week was too short
